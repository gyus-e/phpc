 * Within a thread block, threads are organized into groups of 32 threads called warps. 
 * When threads are executed by a warp, they are assigned a warp lane. 
 * Warp lanes are numbered 0 to 31 and threads from a thread block are assigned to warps in a predictable fashion
 * All threads in the warp execute the same instruction simultaneously. 
 * If some threads within a warp follow a control flow branch in execution while others do not, 
 * the threads which do not follow the branch will be masked off while the threads which follow the branch are executed.
 * It follows that utilization of the GPU is maximized when threads within a warp follow the same control flow path.
 * One implication of warp execution is that thread blocks are best specified to have a total number of threads which is a multiple of 32.

/*
 While it is not necessary to consider warps when writing CUDA code, 
 understanding the warp execution model is helpful in understanding concepts 
 such as global memory coalescing and shared memory bank access patterns. 
 Some advanced programming techniques use specialization of warps within a thread block 
 to limit thread divergence and maximize utilization. 
 This and other optimizations make use of the knowledge that threads are grouped into warps when executing.
